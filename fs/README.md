The purpose of this project was to implement a simple file system abstration ontop of a simulated "disk". The file system included a disk superblock, inode table, directory table and a file descriptor table. The functions that were implemented allows for a file system to be mounted and unmounted along with creating, reading, writing, opening, closing, truncating, and deleting files. Additional functions allowed for file pointer setting, listing files, and getting filesize. The most unique element of this implementation is the use of a bitmap to track disk usage, which is stored on the super block. There aren't enough bytes in a block for the super block to allocate a byte to track every disk block, so a single bit is used to track disk usage.
