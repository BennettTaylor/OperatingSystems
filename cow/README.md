For this project I implemented a TLS which could be created, destroyed, read, written, and cloned. Each thread has its own TLS structure which stored metadata about the storage and had a pointer to the thread's page table. When cloned, not every page was copied into the new thread, instead they pointed to the same page table as the older thread and only changed to a unique page if the page was written to.
